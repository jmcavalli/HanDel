A Chinese Language Learning Program

You will need to have Java on your computer to run this.
If you are unable to see the Chinese characters when you run it, switch your terminal font to a font that contains Chinese characters.
This package also includes the Lexicator application, a nifty tool that creates vocabulary lists suited to your level from a text and adds the new words learned into your learned words list in the save-file.
